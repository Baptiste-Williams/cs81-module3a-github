# Reflection - Module 3A

## What did you learn about using Git and Github?
I learned how to make a repo, add files, and track all the changes I made using commits. 
I also figured out out how to push code to GitHub and edit the files right on site, This was really 
convenient. 

## What was most confusing or frustrating?
So at first, I was kind of confused on how local files worked compared to what shows up on GitHub. 
Other then that, I ran into a small syntax issue with my code, but I fixed and learned a little bit 
more on how JavaScript works. 

## Why do you think developers use Git?
For me, I feel like it really helps to keep things really orginized. I think it will be really 
when working with a team or just by yourself; but the orginization aspect is what I really so so far.

## How might this help with larger projects in the future?
I feel like with bigger project this would be really good to use. I feel like things will be much cleaner
and orginized so that others can see what you did and why you did it. Its like having a conversation 
with anyone that reads your README.
